# AWSCosts: my tools for investigating AWS Costs.
Work in progress.

So far I have tools for generating html tables from Markdown, supporting the rowspan formatting directive so I could create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/PeterGrecian/8c5324cab335e69e7be32c9906b02e64).

I want to be able to read from the AWS pricing API rather than collecting prices manually and the code for that will be here.


## AWS Costs Cheatsheet

* AWS Costs Cheatsheet: yearly costs are much easier to understand than hourly.

For example https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/ says that Standard Kubernetes version support is $0.10 per cluster per hour and Extended Kubernetes version support	is $0.60 per cluster per hour.  This is probably readable from the pricing API.

Is $0.10 per hour a lot of money?  Since there are 8760 hours (by convention) in a year it is **$876**.  Quite a bit.  

$0.60 per hour is most definitely a lot of money: **$5300** per year!  The fact that AWS will punish you for not updating the EKS version every 14 months is hidden when the cost is given per hour.

There are tools such as Cost Explorer which can be used to study AWS costs incurred, however it is also very useful to have an easy to use value for the cost of a resource to use for developing designs.  

The costs do vary with region, but in most cases the costs are within a 10% range. Bulk discounts are usually quite small, and there is the effect of the "always free" quotas which deserve a separate discussion.  Substantial discounts can be obtained for compute, particularly using Reserved Instances in the case of EC2 and RDS, or Compute Savings Plans to a lesser degree for Fargate or Lambda. The completeness or "coverage" of the Reservations is an important factor in how accurately resources can be costed and 2 significant figures is ample.

### Tables in the Cheatsheet for gist markdown and more generally

Markdown lacks rowspan and github lacks styles too.  Converting to html allows rowspan for github and more generally allows styles.

Create html table from .txt which is modified md.  A comment containing the rowspan directive in the first column can be used.  There's quite a bit of hard coding to get this written quickly and "table.py" which uses styles not supported by github gists.
```
  ./gist-table.py cheatsheet.txt > cheatsheet.md
```

### gh gist commands
create secret gist from the md and view in browser
```
  gh gist create cheatsheet.md -w  
```

delete a load of gists

```
name="cheatsheet.md"  # be careful!
yes="--yes"
for g in $(gh gist list | grep $name$ | cut -f 1); do gh gist delete $yes $g; done
```
